# Cryptocurrencies Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning conducted on Cryptocurrencies to assess their tradability.

## Overview

Unsupervised machine learning was conducted on a dataset of cryptocurrencies and their attributes to categorize tradable cryptocurrencies. We used sklearn machine learning functions as well as hvplots and 3D scatter plots to visualize the clusters. We assess the categorical data by digitizing the strings using the .getdummies() function and found the most accurate K value using a K vs Inertia "Elbow Graph".
